# RTS Demo
## A demo project parroting common Real-time Strategy gameplay mechanics

The project emphasizes clean and modular (decoupled) OOP code.  
To that end, it utilizes Scriptable Object Architecture popularized by Ryan Hipple in his [Unite 2017 Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk).
